"""Look at this machine and say what is actually here, so a report can be believed.

Almost everything that goes wrong with this package is one of two things: the
core is fine and the conformance suite it was measured against is not the one
that was meant, or there is no suite at all and the run that looked like a pass
never compared anything. Both are invisible in a traceback, and neither is
something a reporter thinks to mention.

So this looks, and prints what it found in a form that can be pasted into an
issue as it stands.

Two rules shape it. Nothing is hidden: a check that fails says what it saw, and a
check that itself throws is caught and reported as what it threw, named by type,
because a report that says everything is well on a machine where something is not
is worse than no report. And nothing is inferred: every line is something looked
at just now rather than something that ought to be true.

The suite definition sits in the conformance directory rather than in the
package, so an installed copy does not carry one. That is the ordinary case, and
it is also the case this runs in most often, so it is reported as ordinary rather
than raised.
