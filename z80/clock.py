"""Driving a part one cycle at a time, the way a crystal drives one.

`step()` runs a whole instruction because that is the unit a program is written
in. A board has no such unit. It has a clock, and between two edges of it a
cartridge can change what a read will answer, a video chip can raise a line, and
a second processor can take the bus.

Reaching that from outside needs the part suspended part way through an
instruction, and an instruction here is an ordinary call stack: `step` calls a
handler, the handler reads an operand, the read spends a cycle. Python cannot
suspend a call stack. A generator suspends only its own frame, so making the
read yield would mean making every function between it and `step` a generator
too, which is a rewrite of every instruction in the package and a worse one to
read afterwards.

The way round it is the way ares and bsnes take: run the instruction on a thread
of its own and let it block where the cycle is spent. The instruction code stays
exactly as it is and never learns it was interrupted. A cycle costs a pair of
handoffs between two threads, so this is far slower than `step`, and that is the
correct trade: `step` is there when a caller wants speed, and this is there when
a caller wants the truth about where a cycle falls.

Only one thread runs at a time. The worker holds the part while the driver
waits, then the driver holds it while the worker waits, so nothing is shared
concurrently and no lock protects the processor itself.
