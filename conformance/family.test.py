class EveryModuleIsReachedTest(unittest.TestCase):
    """That no module sits in the package with nothing reaching it.

    A module nothing imports and the package does not publish is dead, and dead
    code is worse than absent code when it holds names that also live somewhere
    real. One member carried a `dump.py` defining `read` and `has_copier_stub`
    beside the published ones in `header.py`, superseded by a sibling repository
    and left behind. Both READMEs described it as not exported and not imported,
    which is a defect written down rather than fixed.

    Nothing else catches it. The linter sees a module it was never asked about,
    the type checker checks it and finds it sound, coverage measures it and finds
    it tested, and the one-definition check above is exceptions-only for reasons
    of its own. Every gate passes on code no caller can run.

    Reached means one of two things, and the second is why this reads imports
    rather than asking `dir()`. A module the package binds as an attribute is
    reached by a caller. A module only ever imported by a sibling module is
    reached too, and never appears on the package.

    Test files do not count, and that is the whole difficulty. A dead module
    usually has a test file beside it, written when the module was alive, and it
    is the only thing left importing it. Counting that would make the module look
    reached by the very file that proves nobody else needs it, which is exactly
    what this check found when it was first written and first run.

    A module nobody imports is reached anyway when a person runs it. The doctor
    is exactly that: it is deliberately importable by nothing, because it has to
    survive a package that will not import, and it is run as a file. What makes
    it an entry point rather than dead code is a `__main__` guard, so that is
    what this looks for rather than the doctor's name.
