FAMILY.md is the standard the rest of the family is built to, so a name it
promises and this package does not have is worse than a missing feature: another
repository will be written against the promise. The file is identical in every
repository that carries it, which is what lets one test guard all of them.

Only the mechanical claims are checked here. Whether the reasoning is sound is a
review question; whether `run_for` exists is not.
