"""Fetch the conformance suites this core is held to.

The suites are large, from a hundred megabytes to several gigabytes, and they are
not carried in this repository. This brings down only what is needed: a partial
clone that skips blob history and a sparse checkout that takes only the
directories `suites.json` names.

They are pinned by commit. A build that resolves whatever upstream happens to
hold today is not reproducible, and a change made upstream would turn this
repository red with no commit of its own to explain it. The weekly workflow is
where a newer suite is tried, and it proposes a bump rather than taking one.
