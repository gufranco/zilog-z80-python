"""Ask every address this project cites whether it still answers.

The readme names each document a claim rests on and links to where it can be
fetched. A link is the one part of that record which decays without anyone
touching the repository: a vendor reorganises a site, an archive moves a file,
and the citation quietly becomes a dead end. Nothing in the build notices,
because nothing in the build follows it.

So this walks the readme, collects every address in it, and asks each one
whether it is still there. It changes nothing on its own. The weekly job reads
the report and opens an issue when an address has genuinely gone, which is worth
a person reading, and stays quiet when the failure looks like weather.

The distinction matters more than it sounds. A host that times out once is not a
broken link, and a watcher that cannot tell the two apart teaches a reader to
ignore it. Only a status the server itself returned counts as gone.
