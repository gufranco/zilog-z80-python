"""Look for every sentence these records call a quote in the documents they cite.

A record that quotes a document is making a checkable claim, and until this file
existed nothing checked it. Reading the quotes against the documents by hand
found three defects across this family: a Q and A answer that read 8259 where the
page prints 8080, inverting which part generates three acknowledge pulses; a
quote that dropped a parenthetical while labelled verbatim; and, in the sibling
repository, a sentence about a clock divided into phases that appears in none of
the twelve documents that project pins.

The documents are not in the repository and never will be: none is
redistributable. So this reports what it could not check rather than passing
quietly, and a run with no documents on disk checks nothing and says so.

Matching is deliberately loose. Every document here is a photograph of a printed
book, and the text layer a scan carries prints lhe for the and OP for DP, so an
exact search finds nothing and the absence means nothing. A quote is scored on
how many of its five-word windows appear, which survives hyphenation, collapsed
spaces and a misread word, and still fails a sentence that was never printed.
