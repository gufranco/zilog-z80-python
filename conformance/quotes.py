"""Look for every sentence these records call a quote in the documents they cite.

A record that quotes a document is making a checkable claim, and until this file
existed nothing checked it. Reading the quotes against the documents by hand
found three defects across this family: a Q and A answer that read 8259 where the
page prints 8080, inverting which part generates three acknowledge pulses; a
quote that dropped a parenthetical while labelled verbatim; and, in the sibling
repository, a sentence about a clock divided into phases that appears in none of
the twelve documents that project pins.

The documents are not in the repository and never will be: none is
redistributable. So this reports what it could not check rather than passing
quietly, and a run with no documents on disk checks nothing and says so.

Matching is deliberately loose. Every document here is a photograph of a printed
book, and the text layer a scan carries prints lhe for the and OP for DP, so an
exact search finds nothing and the absence means nothing. A quote is scored on
how many of its five-word windows appear, which survives hyphenation, collapsed
spaces and a misread word, and still fails a sentence that was never printed.

    A data book covers a dozen parts, and several of them are close relatives

    A quote taken from the wrong one reads as perfectly sourced: the words are
    the document's, the table number may even match, and the part is not this
    part. Searching the flattened document cannot catch it, because the flattened
    document contains every section at once.

    So a document record may declare `sectionPages`, the file pages its own part
    occupies. Where it does, every fact citing that document has to name a
    `filePage` inside them. A document that declares no range is single-part and
    nothing here applies to it.

    The pages need not be contiguous. A questions-and-answers section runs
    through the whole family, a few pages per part and back again, so one part's
    material is several blocks with other parts' material between them. A record
    may give a list of ranges for that, and one range is the common case.
