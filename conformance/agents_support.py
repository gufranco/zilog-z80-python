"""Ask agents.md which agents read AGENTS.md, and report any this record does not name.

This repository keeps one instruction file. Most agents read it directly. The
rest each look for a file of their own, so each of those gets a pointer saying
where the instructions are, and agent-files.json is the list of both.

That list ages the moment a new agent ships, and nothing in a build notices: a
tool this repository has never heard of reads nothing, and the silence looks the
same as being covered. So this walks the adopter list published on agents.md and
reports every name the record does not already hold.

It changes nothing on its own. The weekly job reads the report and opens an issue
naming the new agents, because a name on that list means the agent reads
AGENTS.md and therefore needs no file here: the change it asks for is one line in
the record. An agent that does not read AGENTS.md never appears on that page, so
its pointer is added by hand, since the page says which tools read the file and
never says what a tool that does not would read instead.
