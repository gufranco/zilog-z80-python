"""Bring the documents down again, and refuse anything that is not what was read.

The documents are the publishers' rather than this project's, so what the
repository carries is their identity and this script, not the files. A reader who
runs it ends up with the same eight documents that every citation in this
package was taken from, or with an error naming the one that differs.

A digest is the whole point. Two documents can share a title, a publisher and a
revision number and still not be the same file, and a citation against the wrong
one is worse than no citation, because it looks checked.
